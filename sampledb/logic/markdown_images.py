Users may upload images to SampleDB for use in Markdown content. As these
files already need to be available to the user while they are editing the
Markdown document, they are will be stored temporarily, only available to that
user. When the Markdown content is then saved, the images that are actually
referenced (via image elements after rendering the Markdown content to HTML)
will be made permanent.

As these images might be referenced from other places afterwards, an image
that was made permanent will not be deleted when its reference is removed from
the Markdown content that it was uploaded for.
