"""
Logic module for versioned generic object storage

At its core, this module provides a procedural wrapper of models.objects and
models.versioned_json_object_tables. At the same time, the functions contain
additional logic, e.g. for initial default permissions or object logs.

In practice, the flask-sqlalchemy database engine instance is used. So even
though the underlying models only rely on SQLAlchemy Core and not the ORM,
the functions in this module should be called from within a Flask app context.
