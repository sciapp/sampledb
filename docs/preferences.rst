User Preferences
================

Users can edit their preferences by clicking on their name in the top right corner and selecting preferences.

The preferences are split into the following sections:

User Information
----------------

Users can update their user name displayed on iffSamples, e.g. in the event of a marriage. They can also change their e-mail address, which will be updated once the new address has been confirmed.

Authentication Methods
----------------------

Users can have multiple ways of signing in to iffSamples, for example using their LDAP account or using an e-mail address. This section of the user preferences can be used to add, modify or remove such authentication methods, e.g. for users leaving their institute but still requiring access to their sample data.

Default Permissions
-------------------

To automatically set permissions for future objects, user can set **default permissions** in their preferences. These will be applied whenever an object like a sample or measurement is created afterwards.

For more information, see :ref:`object_permissions`.
