Upgrading
=========

To update an existing SampleDB installation, please create a :ref:`backup <backup_and_restore>` and then re-start SampleDB using the Docker image of the new version.

There is no supported path for downgrading SampleDB at this time.

Upgrading the database
----------------------

For upgrading the PostgreSQL database, you can create a backup using the older version of PostgreSQL and then restore that backup using the newer version PostgreSQL.
