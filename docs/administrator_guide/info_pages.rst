Info Pages
==========

Info Pages are Markdown texts that are shown to users when they visit specific routes, containing introductions, explaining workflows or explaining new features to them. Users will need to acknowledge these to proceed, and administrators can check if and when a user has acknowledged specific info pages.

To manage info pages, administrators can go to *More* â†’ *Info Pages*.
