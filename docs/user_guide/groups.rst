Groups
======

Groups are one of the two ways for organizing :ref:`users` in |service_name|. For :ref:`Object Permissions <permissions>`, a group acts as a single entity with all members of the group sharing any permissions granted to it.

Users can be members of any number of groups, leave the groups they are in or invite other users.

As all users in a group are equal, groups may be best suited for those who want to freely share objects with their colleagues without fine-grained permissions. For a more detailed or hierarchical approach, see :ref:`projects`.
