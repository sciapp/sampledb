Topics
======

Topics provide an overview of instruments, actions, or locations assigned to them and allow filtering instruments, actions and locations by topic in their respective lists.
A topic for example could represent a laboratory, actions used in one workflow, or the actions one research group uses.
Multiple topics can be assigned to one action, instrument, or location.
Similar to object filters, users can save their topic filter selection for actions, instruments and locations.

Similar to action types, topics can be displayed in the navbar and on the frontpage.
Administrators can create new topics.

.. note::
    An administrator might have disabled this feature (see :ref:`SAMPLEDB_DISABLE_TOPICS <miscellaneous_config>`)
